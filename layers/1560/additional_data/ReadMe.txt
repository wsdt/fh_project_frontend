Paste here data for your right sidebar. 
E.g. KML-Files with 3D-Objects, etc. 

ONLY CREATE prefixes with exactly 6 chars!

Mainpoints: 
{prefix of length 6}{double underscore}{Name of Object}.{KML-File Extension}
Example: 123456__Mainpoint.kml

Subpoints: 
{prefix of length 6}{one underscore}{Name of Object}.{KML-File Extension}

Fazit: Double underscore = Mainpoint, Single underscore = Subpoint
Prefix groups/refers subpoints to his mainpoint.
